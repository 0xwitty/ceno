/// A message from the prover to the verifier at a given round.

/// 1. The prover sends h(X) to the verifier, corresponding to the sum-check part
///    of the protocol. It is guaranteed that the summed polynomial is of the form
///    eq(X)\sum beta_i f_i(X), where eq(X) is multilinear, and the committed f_i(X)
///    are also multilinear, so the degree of the summed polynomial is at most 2.
///    That's why MAX_DEGREE is set to 2. Note that the prover does not need to send
///    three evaluations of h(X). The prover only sends h(0) and h(2), and the verifier
///    can compute h(1) by h(1) = v - h(0), where v is the current target sum, then the
///    verifier computes the next target sum by
///    h(alpha) = h(0) * (alpha-1) * (alpha-2) / 2 -
///               h(1) * alpha * (alpha-2) +
///               h(2) * alpha * (alpha-1)
/// 2. The verifier replies with random alpha
/// 3. The prover folds the current committed linearly combined polynomial, computes
///    the commitment to the new polynomial, and sends the new commitment to the verifier.
///    However, if this is the last round, i.e., the number of variables in the new polynomial
///    reaches a threshold, the prover simply sends the polynomial in clear.
///
/// Therefore, in each round, the prover message is either
/// 1. Just the polynomial h(X) in its evaluation form
/// 2. The polynomial h(X) in its evaluation form, and the commitment to the new polynomial
/// 3. The last polynomial in clear
